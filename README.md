# The Mutt Matcher (IoT version)

According to the World Health Organization there are more than 200 million stray dogs worldwide. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates over 3 million dogs enter their shelters annually - about 6 dogs per minute! Anything that can reduce the time and effort to take in strays can potentially help millions of dogs every year.

Different breeds have different needs, or react differently to people, so when a stray or lost dog is found, identifying the breed can be a great help.
This device will help workers and volunteers to be able to quickly detect the breed and make decisions on the best way to approach and care for the dog.

We can keep [a set of images](./model-images) for a range of dog breeds to train the ML model using a service called **Custom Vision**.
